Hi! I'm a software developer and real-world problem solver, currently working under the Danaos Management Consultants S.A. Foundation and specializing on web technologies. I enjoy long walks and working out in the gym sporadically but most of my evenings I will be learning some new programming language, following some online course or be working on a personal project. I am keen on the Microsoft stack and products; I use C# and the VS suite for web development and would not trade them anytime soon. I am a firm advocator of the AI technologies so far and will seek to contribute to the AI research during my MsC the upcoming semester. 

Most of my projects at work include both frontend and backend solutions while also working and maintaining the CI/CD lifecycle during deployment. I have had the priviledge to be guided by exceptional senior developers, collaborate with excellent team members and communicate effectively with people from all around the globe. While I am from Greece I can safely say that I prefer the English language which is also backed from around 12.5% of my DNA being Irish. Some keywords for what I consider myself to be good at: C#, .Net, Vue.js, pattern-matching, finding solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems.
